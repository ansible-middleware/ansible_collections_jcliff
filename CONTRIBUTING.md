## Contributor's Guidelines

- All YAML files named with `.yml` extension
- Use spaces around jinja variables. `{{ var }}` over `{{var}}`
- Variables that are internal to the role should be lowercase and start with the role name
- Keep roles self contained - Roles should avoid including tasks from other roles when possible
- Plays should do nothing more than include a list of roles except where `pre_tasks` and `post_tasks` are required when possible
- Separators - Use valid name, ie. underscores (e.g. `my_role` `my_playbook`) not dashes (`my-role`)
- Paths - When defining paths, do not include trailing slashes (e.g. `my_path: /foo` not `my_path: /foo/`). When concatenating paths, follow the same convention (e.g. `{{ my_path }}/bar` not `{{ my_path }}bar`)
- Indentation - Use 2 spaces for each indent
- `vars/` vs `defaults/` - internal or interpolated variables that don't need to change or be overridden by user go in `vars/`, those that a user would likely override, go under `defaults/` directory
- All arguments have a specification in `meta/argument_specs.yml`
- All playbooks/roles should be focused on compatibility with Ansible Automation Platform
